# PoshC2_IOCs

A list of IOCs applicable to PoshC2.

This is a counterpart to the 'Detecting PoshC2' blog post we released, available [here](https://labs.nettitude.com/blog/detecting-poshc2-indicators-of-compromise/):

This repository will be updated as development on PoshC2 continues but community contributions to this repository are encouraged.

Also please note that PoshC2 is open source, so ultimately these detections can potentially be circumvented by configuring or altering PoshC2 appropriately.
